# Radix Converter

A simple app that allows the user to convert numbers between various systems with different radix such as Binary, Decimal, Octal and Hexadecimal. 


This helps students in understanding how to convert numbers between various systems and how the computers convert our messages in such systems to understand them.

## Purpose
This project was created to learn more about how different number systems work and how to convert numbers between them. It also helped me learn more about the tkinter library and how to create a GUI with it. I learnt how important and helpful radix systems are in the world of computers and how they are used to convert our messages into binary numbers that the computer can understand.


## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Programming Language
    - Python
- Libraries
    - tkinter
    - ttkthemes
    - tkinter.scrolledtext
    - string


## Setup
Make sure you have the latest version of python installed on your computer and you have installed the libraries mentioned above. You can install the libraries using the following commands in the terminal:
```
pip install tkinter
pip install ttkthemes
pip install tkinter.scrolledtext
pip install string
```


## Repository Information
This repository consists of a single main.py python file. The file has the folloing functions:
- convert() - converts numbers between different radix systems
- main() - creates the GUI and calls the convert() function
- mainloop() - runs the GUI



## Usage

To run the program, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located. Then run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

To use the application, follow the steps below:
1. Enter the number you want to convert in the input box
2. Select the radix system of the number you entered
3. Select the radix system you want to convert the number to
4. Click on the convert button
5. The converted number will be displayed in the output box
