## Purpose
This project was created to learn more about how different number systems work and how to convert numbers between them. It also helped me learn more about the tkinter library and how to create a GUI with it. I learned how important and helpful radix systems are in the world of computers and how they are used to convert our messages into binary numbers that the computer can understand.


## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Programming Language
    - Python
- Libraries
    - tkinter
    - ttkthemes
    - tkinter.scrolledtext
    - string
